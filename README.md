# crinkle-crinkle :gift:
this code wraps a present in response to a code challenge set by @cassidoo in her newsletter:

```
You have to order wrapping paper for presents. 

Given the length, width, and height of the boxes 
you need to wrap, 
return the number of square feet (or whatever units you want) 
of wrapping paper you need to order. 

Extra credit: allow for other shapes 
of presents and their dimensions!
```

To use it, `git clone https://github.com/Cerchie/crinkle-crinkle.git && node index.js`. Change the values in line 72 
to get the answers you need: `console.log(wrapThatGift(30, 100, 2))` 

This was a family effort. It was coded by me, and the mathematical equations behind it were written by my husband on paper:

My toddler also helped.
